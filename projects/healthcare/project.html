          <h1>Healthcare App</h1>
          <p>Healthcare aims to make accessible testing kits to help people measure their exposure to everyday chemicals that can affect one‚Äôs health. We chose an app to design the user‚Äôs experience with the product because the app allows for intimacy, easy access, portability, and customization for the user. <span class="highlight">I worked within a team of 3 designers helping to design our app's user flow and interaction.</span>
          </p>

        <div class="content-wrap">
          <p>Team: Amanda Yang, Rafaela Fajardo, Arayla Bakhetbek</p>
          <p>Role: UI/UX design</p>
          <p>Type: Iterative Design & User testing</p>
          <p>Date: Fall 2019</p>
          <p>Tools: Figma</p>
          </div>

        <h2>Prompt</h2>
        <p>We were asked to design a speculative interface based on a recent startup and their mission while disregarding any interfaces they have made so far.</p>

        <p>we chose the startup <a class="links" href="https://www.millionmarker.com/">Million Marker</a> and their mission is to let people measure their exposure to environmental chemicals like BPA and phthalates through a mail-in urine test. <span class="highlight">We decided to rename the startup, expand on their mission and product.</span></p>
          
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>We began by asking ourselves what goals we wanted to achieve and why because we wanted to organize and map the user‚Äôs journey with the app to reflect those goals.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="content">
          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>Informed by our thoughts on the user flow, we put together the screens together within figma where we continously made edits based on each other's feedbacks.</p>

          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <p>The wireframe gave us clarity on the user flow which was helpful for translating it to hi-fi designs. Again, our interface aims to make urine analysis results more accessible to users by making it simple and easy to understand.</p>

          <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>We took the prototype and did usertesting through the <a class="links" href = "https://www.usertesting.com/">User Testing site</a> where we ask participants to perform specific tasks.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Overall, we believe that our app works pretty well. Users had some difficulty understanding what was supposed to happen in the beginning, but once they got into the app, they seemed to feel it was more intuitive and easy to use.
 
          <p>The User Testing gave us a deeper insight into how the app would work with a brand new user. Even though we considered different affordances to make the process easier, it worked because we all knew what the kit was about. However, we realized that some information before signing up or ordering a new kit would be helpful for people who are not necessarily informed about the kit already.</p>
