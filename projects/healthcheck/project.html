            Healthcheck app helps people to order urine test kits so they can self-test in the comfort of their home, and after checking their test results, they can take in-app advice to improve their health.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked alongside in a team of 3 other designers to build a MVP version of the app while focusing on the onboarding process, health, kit, and profile page.

          <h2>What‚Äôs the urgency here?</h2>
          <p>
            Current model of urine testing is not convenient, accessible, and comfortable. Urine test is usually asked by our doctors from time to time and for every other annual visits. However, people should actually be self-testing regularly to checkup on their health.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a team, we were thinking how we can streamline this process by leveraging mobile application to give people much more sense of urgency to self-test and especially ownership of their test results?

        <h2>Who are our audiences?</h2>
        <p>
          I was chatting to 3-4 people and was shocked by their experiences. Other people‚Äôs experience were similar to my‚Äôs but also were quite shocking in different ways. This which make me realize the urine testing process needs to be improved. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Research showed generally it is the millennial age range that cares about health & wellness. And given the people I chatted with, it made me decide to cater towards an audience who are in their early 20‚Äôs to late 30‚Äôs.

              While urine test is within the ecosystem of the healthcare system, I wanted to emphasize the targeted experience is within the app and not about the kit purchasing process. Although, it is considered within the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allowed us to focus on the in-app features.

          Drawing out sketches help me to visualize the information on each screens and start thinking how users will interact with it. Let the beautiful ideas in my head out!

        <p>
          Ok, mapping the user journey was a struggle here. As a team, we brainstormed essential information for each screens and what actions can users take.
