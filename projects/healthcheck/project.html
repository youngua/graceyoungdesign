              <h1>Take control of your test results</h1>
              <p>In 2019, healthcare in the states is still not as affordable and accessible to people than before. This is where the technology in people‚Äôs hands can make the process affordable and accessible.
              </p>

              <p>
                What I‚Äôm about to tell you is my journey to designing the Healthcheck App, <span class="highlight">an mobile app aimed at empowering people to self-test with urine testing kits</span>, track the test as it is mailed, and receive lab results through it.

              <h2>I couldn't have done it without</h2>
              <p>
                With an amazing team of three RISD designers, Amanda Yang, Arayla Bakhetbek, and Rafaela Fajardo, we set out to research, design, user test, and prototype the mobile app in fall 2019 and with the 3 week timeline we had.

              <h3>Insights & Goals</h3>
              <h2>Focusing on what matters</h2>
            </div>

            <p>As a team, we recognize that urine tests exist in a healthcare ecosystem. We wanted to change this process and instead focus on a mobile app approach. We agreed <span class="highlight">the app eliminated some of the steps that is needed for in-person testing</span> and believed the app would make the testing experience affordable, accessible, and personable.

          <h3>User Testing</h3>
          <h2>Testing the hypotheses</h2>
          <p>We asked 3 anonymous participants on the Usertesting.com site to follow the scenario and instructions we gave them. <span class="highlight">To figure out if the app focused on the goal we originally set out, we formed two hypothesis:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hypothesis 1: The information presented will be too much for the users to skim through quickly when using the app, they start to ask what the information means.</li>
            <li>Hypothesis 2: The user will spend more time going through the summary of their results and reconsidering their lifestyle habits.</li>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <h2>Recognizing the shift in focus</h2>
          <p>As a team, we agreed that the comments made by the participants aligns with the first hypothesis.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hypothesis 1: The information presented will be too much for the users to skim through quickly when using the app, they start to ask what the information means.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So did we accomplish what we set out to do? Not quite. <span class="highlight">There was a shift in focus from giving the user control of their health report to onboarding the user and essentially engaging with the user within the app.</span></p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <h2>My takeaways</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">Test the app early in the design process.</span> Because the app was tested later in the design process, we believed that testing early as possible even with a wireframe prototype would allow us to recognize the shift in focus of our goals.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Engaging the audience within the app is not a black and white solution but a developing one.</span> Some things we could do is explore different onboarding processes, ways to make data clear, and having a clear returning action within the app.</p>
