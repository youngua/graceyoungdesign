    <h1>Redesigning the portfolio model flow</h1>

    <div class="project-content">
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          I redesigned the portfolio model flow on Farther’s wealth management platform, used by their financial advisors and clients. <mark>As the lead designer, I collaborated with four engineers in a three-week iterative process.</mark>

    <h2>The Process</h2>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Legacy flows meet a tripled advisor team</h3>
      <p>We reached a crucial point in Father’s journey. Our Advisor team tripled, signaling an expansion in our operations. With this growth came the realization that <mark>our MVP flows within the Farther platform were due for an upgrade,</mark>particularly the process of selecting portfolio models by Advisors or clients.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Unveiling our audience: who’s steering the ship?</h3>
      <p>It was essential to define our target user early on. We commonly referred to our user personas, representing our target audience and their investment approach:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>John is a seasoned advisor with deep client relationships, managing all their investments.</li>
        <li>Sarah is a tech-savvy young professional who prefers a hands-on approach to investment management.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>When I engaged in the user discussions with stakeholders, we leaned on these personas as our guiding lights. Ultimately, we reached a consensus: <mark>Advisors would serve as the primary users,</mark> however we acknowledged the need to accommodate secondary users.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="rect" src="img/2.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Uncovering potential solutions through audit</h3>
      <p>This is where I delve into our current product, identifying problem areas, scoping out technical details as needed, and understanding the intricacies of our system.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>During the visual audit, I worked with the designer of the MVP flow, probing into the rationale behind past decisions. Drawing from these insights, <mark>I propose design enhancement for clarity around new and existing data.</mark></p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/3.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Streamlining user journeys</h3>
      <p>In addition to conducting a visual audit, I mapped the user journey. <mark>This enabled me to identify and eliminate redundant screens, as well as rethink the sequence of steps.</mark></p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/4.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Defining the problem</h4>
      <p>Now that I’ve grasped the problems, at high level:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The flow is redundant and challenging to navigate with the current UI</li>
        <li>The UI requires integration of new data</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Coming up with the hypothesis</h4>
      <p>If we simplify the steps, make data interactive, and provide comprehensive details, users can make data-informed decisions, thereby contributing to the growth of Farther’s AUM (Assets Under Management).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Defining the success</h4>
      <p>With a focus on user experience, we aim for users to effortlessly navigate through the flow, anticipating that it will yield the following outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><mark>New advisors continue to join the team</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Farther’s AUM experience exponential growth</mark></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Gaining an edge through competitor research</h3>
      <p><mark>I analyzed competitors to pinpoint opportunities for aligning the Farther’s portfolio model flow with user expectations while also setting us apart in the market.</mark></p>

      <p>Drawing from these insights, I made informed assumptions about user behaviors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users may inquire about their risk tolerance, usually visualized as a bar scale.</li>
        <li> Users may assess asset allocation based on their risk tolerance, usually represented by asset categories and allocation percentages.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <img class="rect" src="img/5.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Reviewing wireframes sketches</h3>
      <p>After drawing inspiration from competitor research and honing my vision, <mark>I quickly sketch wireframes to ensure the new flow is coherent and contains all necessary data.</mark> Once finalized, I present the wireframes to my design team for feedback and refinement.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/6.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Collaborative design implementation</h3>
      <p><mark>During implementation, new considerations prompt scope adjustments and questioning of certain elements as the team interacts with the actual product.</mark> This necessitated collaboration between me and the engineers to refine micro-interactions. Some changes included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing a tagging system to differentiate between Tax Exempted and Taxable custom portfolios.</li>
        <li>Determining the minimum and maximum number of asset classes to display, utilizing 7 colors from our branding system to map each asset class to a color.</li>
        <li>Defining user interaction with the risk level slider, allowing users to slide it across predefined values.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>During the project, I collaborated with the engineers to accurately implement the designs. As a startup in continuous production, <mark>we focus on user experience by self-testing, gathering user feedback, and making iterative enhancements</mark> to ensure our platform meets our target audience's needs.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/1.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <p>This solution was launched in 2022 alongside other projects, with these estimated outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><mark>42+ Advisors select portfolio models for their clients</mark></li>
        <li><mark>3.7% increase in AUM since the update</mark></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Learnings and future improvments</h3>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Engage with users</span> – In retrospect, I could have showcased my early designs to our main users, the Advisors. Eventually, <mark>juggling multiple projects and time constraints taught me to find ways to interact with the users, ensuring this step is not missed during heavy production.</mark></p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Testing amid constraints</span> – While testing and validating ideas for each project would be ideal, it wasn’t feasible during our production-heavy phase. However, overtime, <mark>I form hypothesis to guide my design decisions when testing isn’t possible.</mark></p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Revisiting color</span> – My past excessive use of color in UI design is a lesson learned. After discovering the book “Refactoring UI” by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger, <mark>I’ve adopted a monochromatic scheme for color-intensive UIs. This book now guides my future projects.</mark></p>
