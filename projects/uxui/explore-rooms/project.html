        <p>
          I redesigned Pluto‚Äôs explore page to function as a social for homeowners and contractors, allowing them to discover, like, comment on, and share rooms. <mark>As the lead designer, I worked with the CEO, CTO, 2 engineers over 3 months through an iterative process.</mark></p>

    <!-- Process -->
    <h2>The Process</h2>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Plutos launched room design contest</h3>
      <p>Not long ago, Plutos launched the MVP version of their iOS mobile app. <mark>To expand their user base and increase brand awareness, they also introduced a design contest.</mark> I joined the team on the same day the contest was announced.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/2.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Reminding ourselves who our users were</h3>
      <p>Although the contest was publicly announced, <mark>our goal was to attract potential homeowners</mark> and individuals interested in renovating or designing their spaces."</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/3.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Understanding the current app through an audit</h3>
      <p>The team had an early version of their Explore page. By auditing it, I found several problems and potential solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/4.jpg" />
    
    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Defining the problem</h4>
      <p>In the MVP version of Explore, users must navigate to a separate page to vote and engage with a room post, creating a clunky and less seamless experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Defining the success</h4>
      <p>We want the users to seamlessly navigate through the flow and doing so we hypothesize these outcomes would follow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><mark>Increase in user acquisition</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Increase in user engagement</mark></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Coming up with the hypothesis</h4>
      <p><mark>By simplifying the Explore page to enhance effective participation, we can boost engagement, which in turn will help drive user acquisition.</mark></p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <img class="rect" src="img/1.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <p>Due to shifting priorities, the engineering team focused on other projects at the time, so the initial designs were not implemented. To adapt, I streamlined the designs and handed off a minimal version to enable faster implementation.</p>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>My Learnings and future improvments</h3>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Low user acquisition</span> ‚Äì The contest didn‚Äôt drive the expected user growth, underscoring the need for diversified marketing efforts. In hindsight, I would have pushed to release TikTok videos in addition to our in-app contest efforts.</mark></p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Lack of user engagement</span> ‚Äì We prioritized building new features over strengthening engagement with the core product. In future projects, I‚Äôd identify and address this gap earlier with the team.</p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Concept Feature on Hold</span> ‚Äì Engineering prioritized other features, which put my designs on hold, however this gives me an opportunity to revisit it and iterate. For some designs, I rethink tradeoffs to get to a minimal versions for quicker implementation.</p>
