    <h2>The Process</h2>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Launching an iOS mobile app on the apple store</h3>
      <p><mark>I joined the team right when they were launching the iOS mobile app on the apple store.</mark> I was responsible for enhancing the app's overall experience and designing features from scratch.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Identifying the targeted users</h3>
      <p>Through research, we‚Äôre aware the home renovation is a pain to homeowners. And at first that‚Äôs who we wanted to focus on initially but we quickly decided to focus on the Contractors.</p>
      <br>
      <p><mark>As a team, we identified Contractors as our primary users</mark> and Homeowners as our secondary users.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/2.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>Auditing the app to understand early decisions </h3>
      <p><mark>To understand early decisions I asked the team and audited the app.</mark> In the app, I spotted inconsistencies and friction points in the MVP flow and in those areas, I noted what we can improve.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="rect" src="img/3.jpg" />
    
    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Defining the problem</h4>
      <p>From auditing the app, I pointed out several problems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manual and required fields, hidden requirement, uninspired empowerment, inaccessible feature, and an unbuilt feature</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Defining the success</h4>
      <p>We want the users to seamlessly navigate through the flow and doing so we hypothesize these outcomes would follow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><mark>Increase in revenue</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Increase in user engagement</mark></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h4>Coming up with the hypothesis</h4>
      <p><mark>If we address friction points, build out materials & costs, clarify actions, and enhance transparency,</mark> we can increase revenue and user engagement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>We‚Äôll craft an app renovation experience that is...</h3>
      <p>Early research helped the founders gain a clear vision of how they wanted to market their brand and product. <mark>I distilled the insights into three guiding principles to shape my designs.</mark></p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <img class="rect" src="img/1.jpg" />

    <div class="content-container">
      <p>The latest design version was implemented in Q4 of 2024. The outcome included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved efficiency through a streamlined flow.</li>
        <li><mark>We heard directly from an user who used the Plutos app to secured 2-3 remodeling projects, tripling their income.</mark></li>
      </ul>

    <div class="content-container">
      <h3>My Learnings and future improvments</h3>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">MVP impact</span> ‚Äì This project me helped me reinforce the fact that even a MVP can create significant value for our users. <mark>Early adoption doesn't require every feature‚Äîjust the right ones to drive meaningful transformation.</mark></p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Collaboration challenges</span> ‚Äì I worked with offshore engineers which usually means adjusting the way I communicate. At first, when I relied on verbal or written instructions, it led to gaps, while <mark>sharing prototypes bridged understanding effectively.</mark></p>
      <br>
      <p><span class="bold">Over-communication is key</span> ‚Äì When there was silence after handoff, I thought that generally means alignment. But, after reviewing implementations, it wasn't always the case. <mark>So, I generally follow-up to know how things were going.</mark></p>
