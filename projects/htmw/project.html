          <p>How The Market Works is an educational site that provides resources for people to learn how to invest and manage a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>My goals are to create a <span style="color:#4267ff">(1) clutter-free and engaging website</span> that <span style="color:#4267ff">(2) demystify</span> the stock market and enable users to learn more about <span style="color:#4267ff">(3) world events.</span></p>

          <div class="content">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>I began by examining and exploring the website recording my experiences and asking myself initial questions as preparation for usability testing.</p>

            <p>I ask myself these 5 W questions â€“ What was my intention, when am I on the site, where would I find the stock market, why are there so many information, are they neccessary, who would look at the site, and how do I navigate the site?</p>

            <p>I used these questions as an ice-breaker to the next step</p>

            <h2>Defining problems</h2>
            <p>I evaluated the current <a style="color: #4267ff" href="https://www.howthemarketworks.com/">How the Market Works</a> website with the <a style="color: #4267ff" href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/usability-evaluation.html">usability guidline.</a></p>

            <p>So, what are the people saying?</p>

            <h2>Organizing website architecture</h2>
            <p>How can we demystify the stock market and learn more about world events? I wrote down the website's navigation contents on each post-its and observed how people categorized and group topics and ideas. Understanding how people organize unfamilar information <span style="color:#4267ff">crucial to developing the flow of the website.</span></p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I started this independent project roughly the same time when I was working on Impact Lab's web design. Because of the timing, the experience and knowledge I gained from this project helped me to lead and assist other designers for the Impact Lab's project. This project drove me to utilize my time efficiently and be proactive when searching for participants to engage in the user research and interview process.</p>
